# Steam Screenshot Importer
[Releases](https://github.com/yobson1/steam-screenshot-importer/releases)

Automatic importing of screenshots into steam using the Steamworks SDK.

Each image is converted to a jpeg if required, a 200xY thumbnail is created and then registered with steam. The steam screenshot management window is automatically opened to then allow easy upload to steam cloud.
